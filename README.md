# Hardware Design: ESP32 communication

## How to start?
In this section I will document findings and problems that occured during my preparation work on this project.

My first big question mark was where I should start. My knowledge about hardware design and FPGAs is limited and I only have basic understanding of VHDL. I didn't even know how to write and compile code for the FPGA.

Therefore, I studied ulx3s' manual and subsequently the yosys toolchain documentation. In order to get a better understanding of the whole system and the toolchain, I tried implementing the "Hello world!" of hardware: blinky.

### Using the Toolchain
After implementing my [blinky](blinky.v)  I needed to compile it to a _.bit_-file. Therefore, I studied the _5.2_rtl_to_silicon_ slides. I watched a video on [HDL synthesis with Yosys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVftXFl5tHs) by Claire Wolf and figured out I needed to use the synth command, which executes similar commands to the synthesis script descibed in the slides. It is also worth mentioning that the board uses a ECP5 series FPGA, for which yosys provides a specific synth command (_synth_ecp5_). Afterwards, I used nextpnr for place and route, which takes a JSON as input. After reading the _synth_ecp5_ commands help page, I generated the json via the _-json_ option.

However, I really struggeled while using nextpnr. I neither knew how to generate any output nor how to write a correct constraint file. I found a [Makefile](https://github.com/ulx3s/blink/blob/main/Makefile) which called the _nextpnr-ecp5_ correctly and I copied it to my [deployment script](deploy.sh). Furthermore, the constraint file can be found in the [ULX3S manual](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md). (Note: The leds don't seem to correspond to the numbers on the curcuit board, but it still works? Am I misunderstanding the _.lpf_-file?)

I programmed the FPGA over USB port "US1" and uploaded the _.bit_-files via _fujprog_.

Commands used to generate a _.bit_-file: [deploy.sh](deploy.sh).

### Program the ESP32
The ULX3S' on-board ESP32 can be programmed using the passthru bitstream. The whole process is described in the [ULX3S manual](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).

## Initial Implementation
This section highlights the most important core concepts of my project implementation as well as encountered problems and how I solved them.

### Core Concept
I chose a memory mapped I/O approach for communication between a RISC-V core (running on the FPGA) and the on-board ESP32. I did not implement the RISC-V core by myself but rather used code provided in the lecture _Rechnerarchitektur_.

In contrast to my blinky example, the RISC-V core consists of multiple VHDL files, which can be handled by yosys. 

In order to establish communication between the ESP32 and the core I needed to find possible connection. Accordion to the [ULX3S manual](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md) J1 pins GP,GN 11-13 are shared with the ESP32. I then allocated a designated area in the [memory](rtl/dmem.vhd) for data sent/recieved via those pin connections.

Note, that I have thought about implementing UART but in the end decided against it because of the problems I encountered even during the simple approach. 

### Problems

* One of the first major problems I encountered was a power issue. One of my USB cables could not support the board with a steady 3.3V voltage. Therefore, the ESP32 often shutdown during programming.
* I also managed to brick my ulx3s board by having the ESP32 drive LED pin 5 immediatly after start, which put the ESP32 in some sort of readonly state. I was able to get out of the bricked state by wiring the correct pins to emulate a hard reset. 
* In order to test communication between FPGA and ESP32 I set GP12, which serves as input to the ESP32, to high. The ESP32 in turn is running a small and simple program, that just forwards the input back to the FPGA (see [FPGA](blinky.vhd) and [ESP32](esp32/esp32.ino) code). Strangely, this seems to work in verilog but not in VHDL. In VHDL the pin for fpga-to-esp communication (GP12) is always high no matter what I assign.\
Furthermore, the ESP32 does not start at all when I try to assign HIGH/LOW to GP and GN pins in the RISC-V code. Although this problem slightly differs from the one I just mentioned I suspect a similar route cause: There is some error in my understanding of VHDL I am simply not able to find without help.


### Questions

1. What does a PCLK Pin actually do?


## Refined Implementation

After reviewing the problems with the professor, we agreed a slimmed down version of the project will be sufficient due to the nature of the hardware issues.
For the smaller version, it is enough to load a program into the RISC-V core's memory which should write to an MMIO area that drives the leds.
At first, I wrote a short [assembly](riscvtest.s) program which writes 1 byte to the the memory address 255 (= connected to leds). The byte is then visualized bit-by-bit by the 8 leds on the ULX3S board.

Afterwards, I implemented a more sophisticated counter in C which increments a value every second up to 255 starting with 0. If it reaches 255 it restarts.
I chose C for the implementation because I was keen on exploring the process of getting a program implemented in a high level language running on the RISC-V.
In order to get the code running on the FPGA it has to be loaded into the memory with the following steps:
1.  Write [code](LedCounter/main.c) in C.
2.  Compile C to RISC-V assembly using the [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).
3.  Convert the assembly to hex instructions using [sonic-rv](https://sonic-rv.ics.jku.at/) and copy the result to the [.txt-file](rtl/riscvtest.txt) referenced in the [instruction memory](rtl/imem.vhd).
